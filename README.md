- Setup the multi-region architecture for an application with geo-steering with Cloudflare Load Balancing  to handle requests in multi-region. This monitors server health and directs traffic to healthy servers.
- I worked with Jenkins and GoCD tools to build a customer-driven CICD pipeline.
- Demonstrated leadership to maintain team performance and achieve the project goal.
- Building, managing, and maintaining Kubernetes clusters with K3s, Micro-K8s, EKS, and Rancher.
- Disclose flaws and play a lead role in migrating the old deployment process to a new pipeline.
- Multi-tier architectures were planned and delivered in the Finance and Insurance stream applications.
- I Create a VPC architecture for a financial application using PCI-DSS security compliances, then use the same form to create IAAC (Infrastructure as a Code) using Terraform and CloudFormation.
## Professional Experience
### Senior DevOps Engineer, Deserve Labs [Jun 2021 to Present]
- Deserve is a product-based company providing software as a service to launch credit cards. 
- The Infrastructure is based on AWS Cloud, considering the security bricks at host level, have used AWS Serverless service like AWS Fargets, AWS EKS with Farget and AWS Lambda

#### Project:
**CSP security for enterprise application**
- The project configures content security policies for enterprise applications. It crawls the client's website and processes it to detect vulnerabilities. 
### DevOps Engineer, Talentica Software [Feb 2019 to Oct 2020]
#### Projects:
**AI-powered Semantic Smart contract-based Derivatives Collateral and Liquidity Management**
- The project is using the AWS cloud and GCP as IAAS. Terraform scripts are developed for dev, test, and demo environment resource creation (AWS, EC2, S3, GCP, VM, and Object Store). For creating golden images with security hardening and patch management using Packer open-source tool.
**Digital Ocean managed Kubernetes and microservices**
- The project used the Digital Ocean as IaaS. The microservice-based architecture is using the Maven tool, handling the pom.xml file to build-push jar file and the Docker images to build-push.
#### Terraform automation for 5C webapp
- Created CI/CD architecture in AWS code pipeline, code build, and AWS code deployment. Artifacts were pushed to a central location shared with AWS and GCP.
- I designed the Terraform script to launch a complete application stack for each customer on AWS services: VPC, EC2, S3, code build, code pipeline, code deployment, Cloudfront, ALB, RDS, and Lambda. A similar script was created to launch services in GCP - VM, LB, Cloud SQL, Cloud Function, and Cloud CDN
- The shell script was created to manage Terraform modules created for GCP and AWS.
### Achievement:
- I won the spot award for developing a script that will launch infrastructure in AWS (VPC, Beanstalk, RDS, Code Pipeline, Code Build, and Cloud Front) and deploy application code.
- I received the spot award for my contribution to the project, even though it wasn't my main focus area.
### Meetup and Blog:
- Written blog on Deploy application in K8s using GoCD with CICD pipeline. https://www.talentica.com/blogs/deploy-application-in-kubernetes-cluster-using-gocd-with-helm/ 
- Conducted Talentica Talk session on Terraform code.
- Hosted Meetup talk on K8s Modern Practices: CI/CD in K8s using GoCD
### DevOps Engineer, Applied Cloud Computing Pvt. Ltd. [ May 2017 to Jan 2019]
- Experience with AWS services EC2, VPC, RDS, IAM, S3, CloudTrail, CloudWatch, Trusted Adviser, Load Balancer, CloudFront, CloudWatch, SSM (System Service Manager), AWS Lambda, SNS, Auto Scaling, DynamoDB, and Cloud Formation.
